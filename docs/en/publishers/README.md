This section groups the currently connected targets by purpose. Object storage services share one page to avoid repetition.

## General Usage

```bash
fastforge publish \
  --path <artifact> \
  --target <target> \
  --publish-arg key=value
```

Prefer process environment variables for credentials. Do not commit secrets to the repository.

Uploading a build is not the same as releasing it in a store: review submission, staged rollouts, and store metadata are handled by `fastforge appstore` and `fastforge googleplay`; see [Stores](../stores/README.md).

Use [Local Workflows](../workflows.md) to combine multiple steps.
